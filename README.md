# Food-Truck Fleet

Food-Truck Fleet is a Telegram WebApp game where players manage a fleet of food trucks.
The project consists of two parts:

* **frontend** – a React + TypeScript WebApp built with Vite and TailwindCSS.
* **backend** – a Fastify server (Node.js + TypeScript) responsible for authentication, progress saving and leaderboards.

## Project Structure

```
frontend/  - Telegram WebApp written with React
backend/   - Fastify API
```

Both parts are bootstrapped with minimal configuration so they can be extended for game logic.
